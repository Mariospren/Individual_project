## BestCarsInc.ipynb

### Overview:
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Best Cars Inc. The analysis involves interpreting car data as inventory to make informed decisions efficiently. The notebook utilizes essential libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and later explores libraries like Scikit-learn for Machine Learning processes.

### Required Libraries:
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Execution Requirements:
To execute the notebook successfully, make sure you have:
- Python installed on your system.
- Jupyter Notebook installed to run the .ipynb file.
- The dataset 'vehicles.csv' available in the same directory as the notebook.
- The necessary libraries mentioned above installed in your Python environment.

### Instructions:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook 'BestCarsInc.ipynb'.
2. Ensure the 'vehicles.csv' dataset is present in the same directory.
3. Install the required libraries if not already installed.
4. Run each cell sequentially to perform the EDA, data cleaning, outlier removal, feature analysis, and Ridge Regression modeling.
5. Review the insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
6. Follow the recommendations for selling cars based on the analysis results.

### Note:
